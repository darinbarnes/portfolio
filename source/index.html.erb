      <h3 class="subtitle">What made you switch?<br><br></h3>
      <p>This is the question that I invariably get when I tell people that I've gone from architecture, to graphic design, to user experience design (and for an added bonus, I'll sometimes add in the fact that I started off in nursing). It's always been a slightly difficult question to answer, but a simplified response is that it was never a single thing that made me switch, but rather a series of experiences that helped me discover why I wanted to design.
      <br><br></p>
      <p>Throughout architecture school, I was always interested in the narrative aspect of architectural spaces. How could the experience of Person A differ from (or be the same as) Person B, and how could their experiences overlap? I would work through several iterations of program and circulation diagrams, often leaving the "concrete" architectural details until the very end. As I continued on into the professional world, I began to realize that even though I had a strong appreciation for architectural details, my desire to develop them was not as apparent. I remained very interested in the experiential aspect of architecture and developing methods to communicate these experiences.<br><br></p>
      <p>I decided to pursue this further, and shifted my professional focus to architectural graphic design. I could now diagram and document at length without having to concern myself with waterproofing and the structural integrity of beams. I loved all aspects of this new role in visual communication; creating presentation boards and books, developing architectural diagrams and establishing new marketing packages. Though this was absolutely the best career move I could have made, I began to miss one aspect from my architectural background: designing an experience.<br><br></p>
      <p>I could not tell you where I first discovered User Experience Design, but I can tell you that once I did find it, I knew that it was the perfect way to blend my desire to design and communicate experiences. Since the discovery, I've jumped right in with Bloc, an online UX Design bootcamp, where I've been drawing on my past design experience to help users navigate and engage with digital and physical spaces.<br><br></p>
